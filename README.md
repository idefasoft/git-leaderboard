# Top GitHub Repositories

A site that lets you sort and filter all GitHub repos with more than 1,000 stars.

It uses FastAPI and SQLite for the backend. Every 6 hours, the database is updated.

It also lets you add a badge to your repo to display its rank in the global "leaderboard" of all repos (with more than 1,000 stars).

The official instance is accessible at: [git-leaderboard.dev](https://git-leaderboard.dev/)
